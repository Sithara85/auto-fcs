##  LOD testing





- total of 28 fcs files

![](LOD_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

- TOTAL_COUNTS is the total number of cells in the .fcs file
- one sample had an "undetermined panel" , meaning the .fcs file was probably missing a desc column


![](LOD_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

- panel1TRUE means the sample was successfully gated
- panel1FALSE means the sample was not successfully gated
- panel2TRUE means the sample was successfully gated
- panel2FALSE means the sample was not successfully gated


![](LOD_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->



- only the samples that failed gating
