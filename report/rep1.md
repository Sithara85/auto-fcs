- Mimics manual gating by focusing on 2 channels at a time
  - can follow traditional gate hierarchy
  - e.g. gate lymph, then single, then live, etc
- Pipeline templates defined in .csv file
  - defines algorithmic approach for each gate to be applied across many samples
  - not "just push go", takes some setup for a decent template
- Results are interpretable and labelled populations 
  - not geared toward detecting novel cell types

> The two top performing gating algorithms - OpenCyto (v. 1.7.4), flowDensity (v. 1.4.0) - in a study run by the FlowCAP consortium aimed at selecting the best performing algorithms for this larger study were chosen for the analysis presented in this paper. ***Standardizing Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping Analysis from the Human ImmunoPhenotyping Consortium*** <a name=cite-Finak_2016></a>[Finak, Langweiler, Jaimes, et al.
