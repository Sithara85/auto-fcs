# Mapping workspace to individual fcs files for correlation metrics


```{r collect,eval=TRUE,fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
library(openCyto)
library(ggcyto)
library(flowCore)
outDir = "/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/"
wsDir = "/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/wsp"
wsps <-
  list.files(wsDir,
             pattern = "wsp$",
             full = TRUE)
df = data.frame(
  WSP = character(0),
  FCS = character(0)
)

for(file in wsps){
   ws <- openWorkspace(file)
  s= getSamples(ws)
  # print(paste(file,"\t",s[2]$name))
  tmp = data.frame(
  WSP = file,
  FCS = s[2]$name
)
  
  df = rbind(df,tmp)
}

write.table( df,file = paste(outDir,"fcsMap.txt",sep = ""),sep = "\t",quote = FALSE,row.names = FALSE)
```



for samples in ws:

print ws file, sample


load and gate for sample, 

plot proportions for auto and manual
