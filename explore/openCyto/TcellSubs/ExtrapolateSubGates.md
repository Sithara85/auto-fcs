See if it is possible to incorporate multidimensional Tcell clustering "gates" into .wsp (which requires 2d gates). Researched algorithms/methods to draw polygons around sets of points. Currently can draw overlapping polygon gates (concave/convex hulls similar to https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvh2j.png), but not disjoint.


methods into openCyto workflow (represent clusters in .wsp)

 partion plane into regions based on set membership
