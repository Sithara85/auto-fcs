```{r setup,eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
mets =   read.delim("/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/concordance/all.metrics.txt",stringsAsFactors = FALSE,sep = "\t") 
save(mets,file ="/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/concordance/all.metrics.Rdata" )

```

```{r eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}

load("/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/concordance/all.metrics.Rdata")

metsControls =mets[ctrlUse,]

```
