## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
  ws <- openWorkspace("/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/gates5/2016-05-05_PANEL 1_HB_panel one_F1631958_002.fcs_panel1.wsp")
      gs <-
        parseWorkspace(
          ws,
          path = "/Volumes/Beta/data/flow/fcs3/",
          subset="2016-05-05_PANEL 1_HB_panel one_F1631958_002.fcs",
          name = 1,
          isNcdf = FALSE
        )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
