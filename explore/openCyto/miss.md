Looks like a chunk of them had lower counts.

Also in the list I excluded any that were already manually gated or part of subsets that will not be released in this batch. I did not remove "abnormals" or "bads" however, so I can see if that explains some too. 

For any that you flag as needing manual gating, I'll pull the previous images so we can compare.

Just noticed there should be 99 instead of 98, and looks like 2017-09-26_PANEL1_FORTESSA_RR_group_two_RR_F1631423_020.fcs failed visualizing for some reason- I'll check and see if I can get it plotted
